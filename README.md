Very simple.

If you scored, the goal replay POV will be set to 3rd person.

If you didn't score, the goal replay POV will be set to 1st person.

That way, when you watch your tm8/opponent hit a nutty shot, you can re-watch it from their point of view. But when YOU hit a nutty shot (as I'm sure you always do), you can re-watch it from a different angle!
